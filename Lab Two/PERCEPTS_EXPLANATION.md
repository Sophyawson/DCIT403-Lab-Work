# DCIT403 Lab 2: Perception and Environment Modeling
## Brief Explanation of Percepts

### What are Percepts?

The percepts are those raw sensory inputs that an agent gets from its environment at a single point in time.

Percepts are simply raw, unprocessed environmental information that agent can use for understanding and reacting to its surrounding environment.

For example, in this lab, the percepts are snapshots of the environmental conditions as sensed by the SensorAgent at a specific time stamp.
